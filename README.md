# Horiseon
Horiseon's official website. HTML was reworked to avoid " div soups." Other semantic HTML elements were used in place of the excessive divs to provide better readability. CSS was adjusted to reflect the new elements being used, and consolidated to avoid unnecessary and repetetive declarations. Alt data was added to all photos in efforts to meet accessebility standards. A homepage functionality was also added to the websites h1 element.
