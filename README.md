# Purpose
Horiseon's official website. Horiseon is an agency designed to help you with your SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing needs!

## Project Details
HTML was reworked to avoid " div soups." Other semantic HTML elements were used in place of the excessive divs to provide better readability. CSS was adjusted to reflect the new elements being used, and consolidated to avoid unnecessary and repetetive declarations. Alt data was added to all photos in efforts to meet accessebility standards. A homepage functionality was also added to the websites h1 element.
